## Background
The Floyd Warshall algorithm is an example of dynamic programming. It is used to find shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph with positive or negative edge weights. It is a dynamic-programming algorithm; shortest path distances are calculated bottom up, these estimates are refined until the shortest path is obtained. Positive and zero weight cycles in the graph are ignored, and negative weight cycles are detected.
